description: Flaubert's Madame Bovary is regarded as a masterpiece of nineteenth-century
  literature. However, that novel hinges on a singularly unsympathetic portrayal of
  the title character. In this innovative novel, author Mary Elizabeth Braddon gives
  Mme Bovary a bully pulpit of her own, presenting the same story from the doctor's
  wife's perspective.
